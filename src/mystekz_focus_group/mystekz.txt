MyStekz is the intelligent automation development platform. Within MyStekz you can model your business in a Stek. A Stek is a collection of Domains. In a Domain you can add a description, roles, definitions and products. Within products, you can add a description and processes. Within a process you can add a description and a BPMN process model. This process model can contain tasks which in turn can be enriched with a description as well. All entities within MyStekz can be linked in any text field.
